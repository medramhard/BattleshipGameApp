# Battleship Game App

This is a small two-player console game that has its roots in the game Battleship from Mattel.

Each player gets 5 ships (pegs) and places them on 25-spot grid (A1-E5). After that players take turns "firing" at each other until one of them sinks all 5 ships of the opponent.

General flow of the application:
1. Two users open up the console
2. Ask user_1 for where to place their ships
3. Ask user_2 for where to place their ships
4. Ask user_1 for a shot
    - Determine hit or miss
    - Determin if the game is over
5. Repeat for user_2
6. Repeat until someone wins
7. Identify who the winner is
8. Exit the application
